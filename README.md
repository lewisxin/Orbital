Project Title: UltimateRoute
Overview:
UltimateRoute (UR) is a road route planner for multiple locations. It integrates Google Map API and calculates the best route along multiple destinations. UltimateRoute displays all your destinations in the most optimal sequence. 

Features
Currently, UltimateRoute is focusing on planning the optimal route for car drivers but havenâ€™t touched the area of public transport. By optimal we meant to help users to find the relatively cheap and/or fastest driving route. Some basic features are listed as follows.

a)	Generate ultimate road route for car driver
This is the main feature of our website. Users can key in several places they wish to go. Assuming the input places were interlinked and users were able to reach each places by automobiles. Then UltimateRoute (UR) would process the input data and generate the optimal routes for users.

b)	User Login
Unregistered user can access our website to plan their optimal route, but they are restricted to features c) and d) listed below.

c)	Save your planned trip
After a user registered, UR would create an account for the user. Then the user would be able to save their routes based on personal preferences.

d)	Forum for route sharing
This forum is another feature for registered users. In the forum they can share their trip with other UR users

Features for future development (optional)
Features for future development would be targeting public transport. We aim to provide our users with more travel options. Besides, we also hope to integrate more social element such that users can create their own optimal route and share with other users online.
